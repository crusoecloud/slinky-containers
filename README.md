# Slinky Containers

[SchedMD] provides the images in the containers repository primarily for use
with [Slinky] - to enable the orchestration of [Slurm] clusters using
[Kubernetes]. These [OCI] container images track [Slurm] releases closely.

## Image Registries

OCI artifacts are pushed to public registries:

- [GitHub][github-registry]
- [GitLab Container Registry][gitlab-registry] (automatic CI/CD builds)

For instructions on pulling images from GitLab and using the CI/CD pipeline, see [GITLAB_CI.md](GITLAB_CI.md).

## Build Slurm Images

```sh
export BAKE_IMPORTS="--file ./docker-bake.hcl --file ./$VERSION/$FLAVOR/slurm.hcl"
cd ./schedmd/slurm/
docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS --print
docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS
```

For example, the following will build Slurm 25.11 on Rocky Linux 9.

```sh
export BAKE_IMPORTS="--file ./docker-bake.hcl --file ./25.11/rockylinux9/slurm.hcl"
cd ./schedmd/slurm/
docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS --print
docker bake $BAKE_IMPORTS
```

For additional instructions, see the [build guide][build-guide].

## Support and Development

Feature requests, code contributions, and bug reports are welcome!

Github/Gitlab submitted issues and PRs/MRs are handled on a best effort basis.

The SchedMD official issue tracker is at <https://support.schedmd.com/>.
